\textbf{Title:} Bayesian Inference and MCMC Methods in Astrophysics

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Introduction
  \begin{itemize}

    \item Explain how Quantitative analysis is the backbone of research in modern Astrophysics.
    \item Paragraph about the history of QA in physics (perferably astro), and the trend of problems coming into modern day.
    \item Explain why this review will be focusing spcifically on Bayesian and MCMC: Their popularity in the field, flexibility, and compatibility with many types of problems.
    \item Explain the structure of the rest of the paper.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Methodology section will cover the mathematical theory behind BI and MCMC. It will also explain how to implement them using Python using simple problems as examples.
      \item For each case study, include a paragraph or so sumary about the general background, the problem, and how QA is helping solve it or advance research in the field.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \item Methodology (citing vonToussant, Brewer)
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Bayesian Statistics
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Review of Bayesian statistics and BI.
      \item Include some example problems.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Markov Chain Monte Carlo
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Explain the math and methodology of Monte Carlo methods. \item Show how Markov Chain Monte Carlo builds off it.
      \item Provide examples and the implementation of simple MCMC algoritms (like the Metropolis Algorithm)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Case Studies
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Bayesian Frameworks for Exoplanet detection \\ (Ruffio)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Problem
      \item Methods
      \item Pros/Cons
      \item Extensions
    \end{itemize}
    \item Cosmological Parameter Estimation with MCMC Methods \\ (Akeret) \\ Notes: Make this even more specialized. Read some more about it
    \item Bayesian approach to Gravity wave detection \\ (Littenberg) \\ Notes: Don't go too deep into this. Only talk about detection, don't get into fitting the graviatational waveform.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Conclusion
  \begin{itemize}
    \item State of the field
    \item Areas for future work
    \item 
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
