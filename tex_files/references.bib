These GW events can be possible sites of neutrino emission. In this paper, we present a search for neutrino counterparts of 90 GW candidates using IceCube DeepCore, the low-energy infill array of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The search is conducted using an unbinned maximum likelihood method, within a time window of 1000 s, and uses the spatial and timing information from the GW events. The neutrinos used for the search have energies ranging from a few GeV to several tens of TeV. We do not find any significant emission of neutrinos, and place upper limits on the flux and the isotropic-equivalent energy emitted in low-energy neutrinos. We also conduct a binomial test to search for source populations potentially contributing to neutrino emission. We report a nondetection of a significant neutrino-source population with this test.},

This data release includes the first spectroscopic data from the Apache Point Observatory Galaxy Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), along with spectroscopic data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) taken through 2012 July. The APOGEE instrument is a near-infrared R {$\sim$} 22,500 300 fiber spectrograph covering 1.514--1.696 {$\mu$}m. The APOGEE survey is studying the chemical abundances and radial velocities of roughly 100,000 red giant star candidates in the bulge, bar, disk, and halo of the Milky Way. DR10 includes 178,397 spectra of 57,454 stars, each typically observed three or more times, from APOGEE. Derived quantities from these spectra (radial velocities, effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities) are also included. DR10 also roughly doubles the number of BOSS spectra over those included in the Ninth Data Release. DR10 includes a total of 1,507,954 BOSS spectra comprising 927,844 galaxy spectra, 182,009 quasar spectra, and 159,327 stellar spectra selected over 6373.2 deg2.},

  abstract = {We study the benefits and limits of parallelised Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling in cosmology. MCMC methods are widely used for the estimation of cosmological parameters from a given set of observations and are typically based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Some of the required calculations can however be computationally intensive, meaning that a single long chain can take several hours or days to calculate. In practice, this can be limiting, since the MCMC process needs to be performed many times to test the impact of possible systematics and to understand the robustness of the measurements being made. To achieve greater speed through parallelisation, MCMC algorithms need to have short auto-correlation times and minimal overheads caused by tuning and burn-in. The resulting scalability is hence influenced by two factors, the MCMC overheads and the parallelisation costs. In order to efficiently distribute the MCMC sampling over thousands of cores on modern cloud computing infrastructure, we developed a Python framework called CosmoHammer which embeds emcee, an implementation by Foreman-Mackey et al. (2012) of the affine invariant ensemble sampler by Goodman and Weare (2010). We test the performance of CosmoHammer for cosmological parameter estimation from cosmic microwave background data. While Metropolis-Hastings is dominated by overheads, CosmoHammer is able to accelerate the sampling process from a wall time of 30 hours on a dual core notebook to 16 minutes by scaling out to 2048 cores. Such short wall times for complex data sets opens possibilities for extensive model testing and control of systematics.},

  abstract = {The linear matter power spectrum is an essential ingredient in all theoretical models for interpreting large-scale-structure observables. Although Boltzmann codes such as CLASS or CAMB are very efficient at computing the linear spectrum, the analysis of data usually requires 10 4-10 6~evaluations, which means this task can be the most computationally expensive aspect of data analysis. Here, we address this problem by building a neural network emulator that provides the linear theory (total and cold) matter power spectrum in about one millisecond with {$\approx$}0.2\%(0.5\%) accuracy over redshifts z {$\leq$} 3 (z {$\leq$} 9), and scales10 -4~{$\leq$} k [ h Mpc -1] {$<$} 50. We train this emulator with more than 200,000 measurements, spanning a broad cosmological parameter space that includes massive neutrinos and dynamical dark energy. We show that the parameter range and accuracy of our emulator is enough to get unbiased cosmological constraints in the analysis of a Euclid-like weak lensing survey. Complementing this emulator, we train 15 other emulators for the cross-spectra of various linear fields in Eulerian space, as predicted by 2nd-order Lagrangian Perturbation theory, which can be used to accelerate perturbative bias descriptions of galaxy clustering. Our emulators are specially designed to be used in combination with emulators for~the nonlinear matter power spectrum and for baryonic effects, all of which are publicly available at http://www.dipc.org/bacco.},

  abstract = {We discuss the instrumental and data reduction techniques used to suppress speckle noise with the Simultaneous Differential Imager (SDI) implemented at the VLT and the MMT. SDI uses a quad filter to take images simultaneously at 3 wavelengths surrounding the 1.62 \textmu m methane bandhead found in the spectrum of cool brown dwarfs and gas giants. By performing a difference of images in these filters, speckle noise from the primary can be significantly attenuated, resulting in photon noise limited data. Non-trivial data reduction tools are necessary to pipeline the simultaneous differential imaging. Here we discuss a custom algorithm implemented in IDL to perform this reduction. The script performs basic data reduction tasks but also precisely aligns images taken in each of the filters using a custom shift and subtract routine. In our survey of nearby young stars at the VLT and MMT (see Biller et al., this conference), we achieved H band contrasts {$>$}25000 (5{$\sigma$} ∆F1(1.575 \textmu m) {$>$} 10.0 mag, ∆H{$>$}11.5 mag for a T6 spectral type object) at a separation of 0.5'' from the primary star. We believe that our SDI images are among the highest contrast astronomical images ever made from ground or space for methane rich companions.},

  abstract = {Future space telescopes may be able to directly image between approximately 10 and 100 planets with sizes and orbits consistent with habitable surface conditions (``exo-Earth candidates'' or EECs), but observers will face difficulty in distinguishing these from the potentially hundreds of nonhabitable ``false positives'' which will also be detected. To maximize the efficiency of follow-up observations, a prioritization scheme must be developed to determine which planets are most likely to be EECs. In this paper, we present a Bayesian method for estimating the likelihood that any directly imaged extrasolar planet is a true EEC by interpreting the planet's apparent magnitude and separation in the context of existing exoplanet statistics. As a specific application of this general framework, we use published estimates of the discovery yield of future space-based direct-imaging mission concepts to conduct ``mock surveys'' in which we compute the likelihood that each detected planet is an EEC. We find that it will be difficult to determine which planets are EECs with {$>$}50\% confidence using single-band photometry immediately upon their detection. The best way to reduce this ambiguity would be to constrain the orbit of a given planet by revisiting the system multiple times or through a radial velocity precursor survey. Astrometric or radial velocity constraints on the mass of the planet would offer a lesser benefit. Finally, we show that a Bayesian approach to prioritizing targets would improve the follow-up efficiency of a direct imaging survey versus a blind approach using the same data. For example, the prioritized approach could reduce the amount of integration time required for the spectral detection (or rejection) of water absorption in most EECs by a factor of two.},

  abstract = {Data volumes from multiple sky surveys have grown from gigabytes into terabytes during the past decade, and will grow from terabytes into tens (or hundreds) of petabytes in the next decade. This exponential growth of new data both enables and challenges effective astronomical research, requiring new approaches. Thus far, astronomy has tended to address these challenges in an informal and ad hoc manner, with the necessary special expertise being assigned to e-Science or survey science. However, we see an even wider scope and therefore promote a broader vision of this data-driven revolution in astronomical research. For astronomy to effectively cope with and reap the maximum scientific return from existing and future large sky surveys, facilities, and data-producing projects, we need our own information science specialists. We therefore recommend the formal creation, recognition, and support of a major new discipline, which we call Astroinformatics. Astroinformatics includes a set of naturally-related specialties including data organization, data description, astronomical classification taxonomies, astronomical concept ontologies, data mining, machine learning, visualization, and astrostatistics. By virtue of its new stature, we propose that astronomy now needs to integrate Astroinformatics as a formal sub-discipline within agency funding plans, university departments, research programs, graduate training, and undergraduate education. Now is the time for the recognition of Astroinformatics as an essential methodology of astronomical research. The future of astronomy depends on it.},

  abstract = {"Bayesian methods are increasingly being employed in many different areas of physical sciences research. In astrophysics, models are used to make predictions to compare to observations that are incomplete and uncertain, so the comparison must be pursued by following a probabilistic approach. With contributions from leading experts, this volume covers the foundations of Bayesian inference, a description of the applicable computational methods, and recent results from their application to areas such as exoplanet detection and characterisation, image reconstruction, and cosmology. With content that appeals both to young researchers seeking to learn about Bayesian methods and to astronomers wishing to incorporate these approaches into their research, it provides the next generation of researchers with tools of modern data analysis that are becoming standard in astrophysical research"},

A likely science mission of that observatory is the detection and characterization of `Earth-like' exoplanets. Direct exoplanet observation requires a telescope to see a planet that is 10\textsuperscript{-10 }times dimmer than its host star. To accomplish this using an internal coronagraph requires a telescope with an ultra-stable wavefront. This paper investigates two topics: 1) parametric relationships between a primary mirror's thermal parameters and wavefront stability, and 2) optimal temperature profiles in the telescope's shroud and heater plate that minimize static wavefront error (WFE) in the primary mirror.},

At a separation of {$\sim$}0.{${''}$}82 (87 au), HIP 65426b is clearly detected in all seven of our observational filters, representing the first images of an exoplanet to be obtained by JWST, and the first-ever direct detection of an exoplanet beyond 5 {$\mu$}m. These observations demonstrate that JWST is exceeding its nominal predicted performance by up to a factor of 10, depending on separation and subtraction method, with measured 5{$\sigma$} contrast limits of {$\sim$}1 \texttimes{} 10-5 and {$\sim$}2 \texttimes{} 10-4 at 1{${''}$} for NIRCam at 4.4 {$\mu$}m and MIRI at 11.3 {$\mu$}m, respectively. These contrast limits provide sensitivity to sub-Jupiter companions with masses as low as 0.3M Jup beyond separations of {$\sim$}100 au. Together with existing ground-based near-infrared data, the JWST photometry are fit well by a BT-SETTL atmospheric model from 1 to 16 {$\mu$}m, and they span {$\sim$}97\% of HIP 65426b's luminous range. Independent of the choice of model atmosphere, we measure an empirical bolometric luminosity that is tightly constrained between = -4.31 and -4.14, which in turn provides a robust mass constraint of 7.1 \textpm{} 1.2 M Jup. In totality, these observations confirm that JWST presents a powerful and exciting opportunity to characterize the population of exoplanets amenable to high-contrast imaging in greater detail.},

Bayesian inference, central to linking astronomical data to nonlinear astrophysical models, addresses problems in solar physics, properties of star clusters, and exoplanet systems. Likelihood-free methods are growing in importance. Detection of faint signals in complicated noise is needed to find periodic behaviors in stars and detect explosive gravitational wave events. Open issues concern treatment of heteroscedastic measurement errors and understanding probability distributions characterizing astrophysical systems. The field of astrostatistics needs increased collaboration with statisticians in the design and analysis stages of research projects, and to jointly develop new statistical methodologies.

  abstract = {Methods. The Gaia DR3 catalogue is the outcome of the processing of raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium. Results. The Gaia DR3 catalogue contains the same source list, celestial positions, proper motions, parallaxes, and broad band photometry in the G, GBP, and GRP pass-bands already present in the Early Third Data Release, Gaia EDR3. Gaia DR3 introduces an impressive wealth of new data products. More than 33 million objects in the ranges GRVS {$<$} 14 and 3100 {$<$} Teff {$<$} 14 500, have new determinations of their mean radial velocities based on data collected by Gaia. We provide GRVS magnitudes for most sources with radial velocities, and a line broadening parameter is listed for a subset of these. Mean Gaia spectra are made available to the community. The Gaia DR3 catalogue includes about 1 million mean spectra from the radial velocity spectrometer, and about 220 million low-resolution blue and red prism photometer BP/RP mean spectra. The results of the analysis of epoch photometry are provided for some 10 million sources across 24 variability types. Gaia DR3 includes astrophysical parameters and source class probabilities for about 470 million and 1500 million sources, respectively, including stars, galaxies, and quasars. Orbital elements and trend parameters are provided for some 800 000 astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries. More than 150 000 Solar System objects, including new discoveries, with preliminary orbital solutions and individual epoch observations are part of this release. Reflectance spectra derived from the epoch BP/RP spectral data are published for about 60 000 asteroids. Finally, an additional data set is provided, namely the Gaia Andromeda Photometric Survey, consisting of the photometric time series for all sources located in a 5.5 degree radius field centred on the Andromeda galaxy. Conclusions. This data release represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR2 and Gaia EDR3 because of the unprecedented quantity, quality, and variety of source astrophysical data. To date this is the largest collection of all-sky spectrophotometry, radial velocities, variables, and astrophysical parameters derived from both low- and high-resolution spectra and includes a spectrophotometric and dynamical survey of SSOs of the highest accuracy. The non-single star content surpasses the existing data by orders of magnitude. The quasar host and galaxy light profile collection is the first such survey that is all sky and space based. The astrophysical information provided in Gaia DR3 will unleash the full potential of Gaia's exquisite astrometric, photometric, and radial velocity surveys.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the problem of scaling the proposal distribution of a multidimensional random walk Metropolis algorithm in order to maximize the efficiency of the algorithm. The main result is a weak convergence result as the dimension of a sequence of target densities, n, converges to \$\textbackslash infty\$. When the proposal variance is appropriately scaled according to n, the sequence of stochastic processes formed by the first component of each Markov chain converges to the appropriate limiting Langevin diffusion process. The limiting diffusion approximation admits a straightforward efficiency maximization problem, and the resulting asymptotically optimal policy is related to the asymptotic acceptance rate of proposed moves for the algorithm. The asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is 0.234 under quite general conditions. The main result is proved in the case where the target density has a symmetric product form. Extensions of the result are discussed.},

  abstract = {Direct imaging is likely the best way to characterize the atmospheres of Earth-sized exoplanets in the habitable zone of Sun-like stars. Previously, Stark et al. estimated the Earth twin yield of future direct imaging missions, such as LUVOIR and HabEx. We extend this analysis to other types of planets, which will act as false positives for Earth twins. We define an Earth twin as any exoplanet within half an e-folding of 1 au in semimajor axis and 1 in planetary radius, orbiting a G-dwarf. Using Monte Carlo analyses, we quantify the biases and planetary false-positive rates of Earth searches. That is, given a pale dot at the correct projected separation and brightness to be a candidate Earth, what are the odds that it is, in fact, an Earth twin? Our notional telescope has a diameter of 10 m, an inner working angle of 3{$\lambda$}/D, and an outer working angle of 10{$\lambda$}/D (62 mas and 206 mas at 1.0 {$\mu$}m). With no precursor knowledge and one visit per star, 77\% of detected candidate Earths are actually un-Earths; their mean radius is 2.3 , a sub-Neptune. The odds improve if we image every planet at its optimal orbital phase, either by relying on precursor knowledge, or by performing multi-epoch direct imaging. In such a targeted search, 47\% of detected Earth twin candidates are false positives, and they have a mean radius of 1.7 . The false-positive rate is insensitive to stellar spectral type and the assumption of circular orbits.},

  abstract = {Using two aspheric mirrors, it is possible to apodize a telescope beam without losing light or angular resolution: the output beam is produced by "remapping" the entrance beam to produce the desired light intensity distribution in a new pupil. We present the phase-induced amplitude apodization coronagraph (PIAAC) concept, which uses this technique, and show that it allows efficient direct imaging of extrasolar terrestrial planets with a small-sized telescope in space. The suitability of the PIAAC for exoplanet imaging is due to a unique combination of achromaticity, small inner working angle (about 1.5{$\lambda$}/d), high throughput, high angular resolution, and large field of view. Three-dimensional geometrical ray tracing is used to investigate the off-axis aberrations of PIAAC configurations and show that a field of view of more than 100{$\lambda$}/d in radius is available thanks to the correcting optics of the PIAAC. Angular diameter of the star and tip-tilt errors can be compensated for by slightly increasing the size of the occulting mask in the focal plane, with minimal impact on the system performance. Earth-sized planets at 10 pc can be detected in less than 30 s with a 4 m telescope. Wave-front quality requirements are similar to classical techniques.},

  abstract = {In a previous paper1 the writer discussed the possibility of explaining the observed clustering effects among extragalactic nebulae as a result of captures. The present investigation deals with the important problem of whether the loss of energy resulting from the tidal disturbances at a close encounter between two nebulae is large enough to effect a capture. The tidal deformations of two models of stellar systems, passing each other at a small distance, are studied by reconstructing, piece by piece, the orbits described by the individual mass elements. The difficulty of integrating the total gravitational force acting upon a certain element at a certain point of time is solved by replacing gravitation by light. The mass elements are represented by light-bulbs, the candle power being proportional to mass, and the total light is measured by a photocell (Fig. i). The nebulae are assumed to have a flattened shape, and each is represented by 37 light-bulbs. It is found that the tidal deformations cause an increase in the attraction between the two objects, the increase reaching its maximum value when the nebulae are separating, i.e., after the passage. The resulting loss of energy (Fig. 6) is comparatively large and may, in favorable cases, effect a capture. The spiral arms developing during the encounter (Figs. 4) represent an interesting by-product of the investigation. The direction of the arms depends on the direction of rotation of the nebulae with respect to the direction of their space motions.},

For example, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which will begin operations in northern Chile in 2022, will generate a nearly 150 Petabyte imaging dataset of the southern hemisphere sky. The LSST will stream data at rates of 2 Terabytes per hour, effectively capturing an unprecedented movie of the sky. The LSST is expected not only to improve our understanding of time-varying astrophysical objects, but also to reveal a plethora of yet unknown faint and fast-varying phenomena. To cope with a change of paradigm to data-driven astronomy, the fields of astroinformatics and astrostatistics have been created recently. The new data-oriented paradigms for astronomy combine statistics, data mining, knowledge discovery, machine learning and computational intelligence, in order to provide the automated and robust methods needed for the rapid detection and classification of known astrophysical objects as well as the unsupervised characterization of novel phenomena. In this article we present an overview of machine learning and computational intelligence applications to TDA. Future big data challenges and new lines of research in TDA, focusing on the LSST, are identified and discussed from the viewpoint of computational intelligence/machine learning. Interdisciplinary collaboration will be required to cope with the challenges posed by the deluge of astronomical data coming from the LSST.},

  abstract = {Direct imaging of exoplanets is limited by bright quasi-static speckles in the point spread function (PSF) of the central star. This limitation can be reduced by subtraction of reference PSF images. We have developed an algorithm to construct an optimized reference PSF image from a set of reference images. This image is built as a linear combination of the reference images available and the coefficients of the combination are optimized inside multiple subsections of the image independently to minimize the residual noise within each subsection. The algorithm developed can be used with many high-contrast imaging observing strategies relying on PSF subtraction, such as angular differential imaging (ADI), roll subtraction, spectral differential imaging, reference star observations, etc. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated for ADI data. It is shown that for this type of data the new algorithm provides a gain in sensitivity by up to a factor 3 at small separation over the algorithm used in Marois et al. (2006).},

  abstract = {The high contrast and spatial resolution requirements for directly imaging exoplanets requires effective coordination of wavefront control, coronagraphy, observation techniques, and post-processing algorithms. However, even with this suite of tools, identifying and retrieving exoplanet signals embedded in resolved scattered light regions can be extremely challenging due to the increased noise from scattered light off the circumstellar disk and the potential misinterpretation of the true nature of the detected signal. This issue pertains not only to imaging terrestrial planets in habitable zones within zodiacal and exozodiacal emission but also to young planets embedded in circumstellar, transitional, and debris disks. This is particularly true for H{$\alpha$} detection of exoplanets in transitional disks. This work delves into recent H{$\alpha$} observations of three transitional disks systems with MagAO-X, an extreme adaptive optics system for the 6.5-meter Magellan Clay telescope. We employed angular differential imaging (ADI) and simultaneous spectral differential imaging (SSDI) in combination with KLIP, a PCA algorithm in post-processing, for optimal starlight suppression and quasi-static noise removal. We discuss the challenges in protoplanet identification with MagAO-X in environments rich with scattered and reflected light from disk structures and explore a potential solution for removing noise contributions from real astronomical objects with current observation and post-processing techniques.},

With more than 250 planet detections, it is the most prolific technique to date and has led to many milestone discoveries, such as hot Jupiters, multiplanet systems, transiting planets around bright stars, the planet-metallicity correlation, planets around M dwarfs and intermediate-mass stars, and recently, the emergence of a population of low-mass planets: Neptune-mass planets and super-Earths. In the near future radial velocities are expected to systematically explore the domain of rocky and icy planets down to a few Earth masses close to the habitable zone of their parent star. Radial velocity measurements will also be used to provide the necessary follow-up observations of transiting candidates detected by space missions. Finally, we also note alternative radial velocity techniques that may play an important role in the future.},

The thousands of exoplanets discovered over the past decade have most recently been supplemented by discoveries of potentially habitable planets around nearby low-mass stars. Currently, the field is rapidly progressing toward detailed spectroscopic observations to characterize the atmospheres of these planets. Various surveys from space and the ground are expected to detect numerous more exoplanets orbiting nearby stars that make the planets conducive for atmospheric characterization. The current state of this frontier of exoplanetary atmospheres may be summarized as follows. ▪ We have entered the era of comparative exoplanetology thanks to high-fidelity atmospheric observations now available for tens of exoplanets. ▪ Recent studies reveal a rich diversity of chemical compositions and atmospheric processes hitherto unseen in the Solar System. ▪ Elemental abundances of exoplanetary atmospheres place important constraints on exoplanetary formation and migration histories. ▪ Upcoming observational facilities promise to revolutionize exoplanetary spectroscopy down to rocky exoplanets. ▪ The detection of a biosignature in an exoplanetary atmosphere is conceivable over the next decade. In the present review, we discuss the modern and future landscape of this frontier area of exoplanetary atmospheres. We start with a brief review of the area, emphasising the key insights gained from different observationalmethods and theoretical studies. This is followed by an in-depth discussion of the state of the art, challenges, and future prospects in three forefront branches of the area.},

High-contrast observations with the Keck and Gemini telescopes have revealed three planets orbiting the star HR 8799, with projected separations of 24, 38, and 68 astronomical units. Multi-epoch data show counter-clockwise orbital motion for all three imaged planets. The low luminosity of the companions and the estimated age of the system imply planetary masses between 5 and 13 times that of Jupiter.

The H-band data reach a contrast of 12.7 mag relative to the host star at 5{$\sigma$} levels in the location of HD 95086 b, and no point source is found. Our non-detection and H - L{$\prime$} color limit rules out the possibility that the object is a foreground L/T dwarf and that, if it is bound to HD 95086, it is a genuine planetary mass object. We estimate a new pre-main-sequence isochronal age for HD 95086 of 17 \textpm{} 4 Myr, which is commensurate with previous mean age estimates for the Lower Cen-Crux subgroup. Adopting an age of 17 Myr, the color limit is inconsistent with the COND model, marginally consistent with the BT-SETTL model, and consistent with the DUSTY model.},

  abstract = {The mission of NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) is to find Earth-like planets orbiting other stars and characterize the atmospheres of these planets using spectroscopy. Because of the enormous brightness ratio between the star and the reflected light from the planet, techniques must be found to reduce the brightness of the star. The current favorite approach to doing this is with interferometry: interfering the light from two or more separated telescopes with a {$\pi$} phase shift, nulling out the starlight. While this technique can, in principle, achieve the required dynamic range, building a space interferometer that has the necessary characteristics poses immense technical difficulties. In this paper, we suggest a much simpler approach to achieving the required dynamic range. By simply adjusting the transmissive shape of a telescope aperture, the intensity in large regions around the stellar image can be reduced nearly to zero. This approach could lead to construction of a TPF using conventional technologies, requiring space optics on a much smaller scale than the current TPF approach.},

  abstract = {We present cluster counts and corresponding cosmological constraints from the Planck full mission data set. Our catalogue consists of 439 clusters detected via their Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal down to a signal-to-noise ratio of 6, and is more than a factor of 2 larger than the 2013 Planck cluster cosmology sample. The counts are consistent with those from 2013 and yield compatible constraints under the same modelling assumptions. Taking advantage of the larger catalogue, we extend our analysis to the two-dimensional distribution in redshift and signal-to-noise. We use mass estimates from two recent studies of gravitational lensing of background galaxies by Planck clusters to provide priors on the hydrostatic bias parameter, \$(1-b)\$. In addition, we use lensing of cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations by Planck clusters as an independent constraint on this parameter. These various calibrations imply constraints on the present-day amplitude of matter fluctuations in varying degrees of tension with those from the Planck analysis of primary fluctuations in the CMB; for the lowest estimated values of \$(1-b)\$ the tension is mild, only a little over one standard deviation, while it remains substantial (\$3.7\textbackslash,\textbackslash sigma\$) for the largest estimated value. We also examine constraints on extensions to the base flat \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model by combining the cluster and CMB constraints. The combination appears to favour non-minimal neutrino masses, but this possibility does little to relieve the overall tension because it simultaneously lowers the implied value of the Hubble parameter, thereby exacerbating the discrepancy with most current astrophysical estimates. Improving the precision of cluster mass calibrations from the current 10\%-level to 1\% would significantly strengthen these combined analyses and provide a stringent test of the base \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model.},

We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \$\textbackslash Omega\_c h\textasciicircum 2 = 0.120\textbackslash pm 0.001\$, baryon density \$\textbackslash Omega\_b h\textasciicircum 2 = 0.0224\textbackslash pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965\textbackslash pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \$\textbackslash tau = 0.054\textbackslash pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ precision, with \$100\textbackslash theta\_*=1.0411\textbackslash pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4\textbackslash pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \$\textbackslash Omega\_m = 0.315\textbackslash pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \$\textbackslash sigma\_8 = 0.811\textbackslash pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash rm eff\textbraceright{} = 2.99\textbackslash pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \$\textbackslash sum m\_\textbackslash nu{$<$} 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM at over \$2\textbackslash,\textbackslash sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.

  abstract = {Apodization applied to the pupil functions was widely used for the light field manipulation in the focal region of the optical focusing systems. Apodization pupils were divided into three categories by the structure type, i.e. slit, circular and complex pupil functions. For one-dimensional (slit type) apodization functions, the point spread function was obtained with suppressed sidelobes. The magnitude of reduction of the sidelobes was found to increased by the amplitude apodization across the slit function. For apodized circular pupil functions, the axial resolution of the optical systems was improved, and it was very helpful to improve the two-point resolution in the presence of optical aberrations such as defocus and spherical aberration. For complex apodized pupil functions, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the point spread function (PSF) was obtained less than that of the Airy PSF. The study proved that, within certain conditions, the complex apodizer was effective in removing the sidelobes from the aberrated impulse response (or PSF). In this review, a systematic study was performed in which the effect of aberrations and the complex apodization were used to improve the performance of the optical systems for resolving the two closely located point-sources under the incoherent, partially coherent and fully coherent light illumination. The concepts of the amplitude and phase diffractive optical elements were applied to reduce the size of the focal spot at tight focusing of differently polarized laser beams. This technique was also applied to increase the resolution beyond the diffraction limit for the composite image intensity distribution of the far-field objects formed by the incoherent optical system.},

  abstract = {Distinct gap features in the nearest protoplanetary disk, TW Hya (distance of 59.5 \textpm{} 0.9 pc), may be signposts of ongoing planet formation. We performed long-exposure thermal infrared coronagraphic imaging observations to search for accreting planets, especially within dust gaps previously detected in scattered light and submillimeter-wave thermal emission. Three nights of observations with the Keck/NIRC2 vortex coronagraph in L{$\prime$} (3.4--4.1 {$\mu$}m) did not reveal any statistically significant point sources. We thereby set strict upper limits on the masses of non-accreting planets. In the four most prominent disk gaps at 24, 41, 47, and 88 au, we obtain upper mass limits of 1.6--2.3, 1.1--1.6, 1.1--1.5, and 1.0--1.2 Jupiter masses (MJ), assuming an age range of 7--10 Myr for TW Hya. These limits correspond to the contrast at 95\% completeness (true positive fraction of 0.95) with a 1\% chance of a false positive within 1{${''}$} of the star. We also approximate an upper limit on the product of the planet mass and planetary accretion rate of implying that any putative {$\sim$}0.1 MJ planet, which could be responsible for opening the 24 au gap, is presently accreting at rates insufficient to build up a Jupiter mass within TW Hya's pre-main-sequence lifetime.},

  abstract = {Rigorously quantifying the information in high-contrast imaging data is important for informing follow-up strategies to confirm the substellar nature of a point source, constraining theoretical models of planet--disk interactions, and deriving planet occurrence rates. However, within the exoplanet direct imaging community, nondetections have almost exclusively been defined using a frequentist detection threshold (i.e., contrast curve) and associated completeness. This can lead to conceptual inconsistencies when included in a Bayesian framework. A Bayesian upper limit is such that the true value of a parameter lies below this limit with a certain probability. The associated probability is the integral of the posterior distribution with the upper limit as the upper bound. In summary, a frequentist upper limit is a statement about the detectability of planets while a Bayesian upper limit is a statement about the probability of a parameter to lie in an interval given the data. The latter is therefore better suited for rejecting hypotheses or theoretical models based on their predictions. In this work we emphasize that Bayesian statistics and upper limits are more easily interpreted and typically more constraining than the frequentist approach. We illustrate the use of Bayesian analysis in two different cases: (1) with a known planet location where we also propose to use model comparison to constrain the astrophysical nature of the point source and (2) gap-carving planets in TW Hya. To finish, we also mention the problem of combining radial velocity and direct imaging observations.},

  abstract = {Mapping the local and distant Universe is key to our understanding of it. For decades, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has made a concerted effort to map millions of celestial objects to constrain the physical processes that govern our Universe. The most recent and fifth generation of SDSS (SDSS-V) is organized into three scientific ``mappers". Milky Way Mapper (MWM) that aims to chart the various components of the Milky Way and constrain its formation and assembly, Black Hole Mapper (BHM), which focuses on understanding supermassive black holes in distant galaxies across the Universe, and Local Volume Mapper (LVM), which uses integral field spectroscopy to map the ionized interstellar medium in the local group. This paper describes and outlines the scope and content for the nineteenth data release (DR19) of SDSS and the most substantial to date in SDSS-V. DR19 is the first to contain data from all three mappers. Additionally, we also describe nine value added catalogs (VACs) that enhance the science that can be conducted with the SDSS-V data. Finally, we discuss how to access SDSS DR19 and provide illustrative examples and tutorials.},

  abstract = {Thousands of exoplanets are known to orbit nearby stars. Plans for the next generation of space-based and ground-based telescopes are fueling the anticipation that a precious few habitable planets can be identified in the coming decade. Even more highly anticipated is the chance to find signs of life on these habitable planets by way of biosignature gases. But which gases should we search for? Although a few biosignature gases are prominent in Earth's atmospheric spectrum (O2, CH4, N2O), others have been considered as being produced at or able to accumulate to higher levels on exo-Earths (e.g., dimethyl sulfide and CH3Cl). Life on Earth produces thousands of different gases (although most in very small quantities). Some might be produced and/or accumulate in an exo-Earth atmosphere to high levels, depending on the exo-Earth ecology and surface and atmospheric chemistry.To maximize our chances of recognizing biosignature gases, we promote the concept that all stable and potentially volatile molecules should initially be considered as viable biosignature gases. We present a new approach to the subject of biosignature gases by systematically constructing lists of volatile molecules in different categories. An exhaustive list up to six non-H atoms is presented, totaling about 14,000 molecules. About 2500 of these are CNOPSH compounds. An approach for extending the list to larger molecules is described. We further show that about one-fourth of CNOPSH molecules (again, up to N\,=\,6 non-H atoms) are known to be produced by life on Earth. The list can be used to study classes of chemicals that might be potential biosignature gases, considering their accumulation and possible false positives on exoplanets with atmospheres and surface environments different from Earth's. The list can also be used for terrestrial biochemistry applications, some examples of which are provided. We provide an online community usage database to serve as a registry for volatile molecules including biogenic compounds. Key Words: Astrobiology---Atmospheric gases---Biosignatures---Exoplanets.

We provide an introduction to the key CMB observables including temperature and polarization anisotropies, and describe recent progress towards understanding the initial conditions of structure formation, and establishing the properties of the contents of the universe including neutrinos. Results are now being derived both from the primordial CMB signal that traces the behavior of the universe at 400 000 years of cosmic time, as well as from the signals imprinted at later times due to scattering from galaxy clusters, from the motion of electrons in the ionized universe, and from the gravitational lensing of the CMB photons. We describe current experimental methods to measure the CMB, particularly focusing on details relevant for ground and balloon-based instruments, and give an overview of the broad data analysis methods required to convert measurements of the microwave sky into cosmological parameters.},

We present a comprehensive discussion of methods for estimating cosmological parameters from large data sets, which includes the previously published techniques as special cases. We show that both the problem of estimating several parameters jointly and the problem of not knowing the parameters a priori can be readily solved by adding an extra singular value decomposition step. It has recently been argued that the information content in a sky map from a next generation CMB satellite is sufficient to measure key cosmological parameters (h, Omega, Lambda, etc) to an accuracy of a few percent or better - in principle. In practice, the data set is so large that both a brute force likelihood analysis and a direct expansion in signal-to-noise eigenmodes will be computationally unfeasible. We argue that it is likely that a Karhunen-Loeve approach can nonetheless measure the parameters with close to maximal accuracy, if preceded by an appropriate form of quadratic "pre-compression". We also discuss practical issues regarding parameter estimation from present and future galaxy redshift surveys, and illustrate this with a generalized eigenmode analysis of the IRAS 1.2 Jy survey optimized for measuring beta=Omega\textasciicircum\textbraceleft 0.6\textbraceright/b using redshift space distortions.},

The exoplanets around stars in the solar neighborhood are expected to be bright enough for us to characterize them with direct imaging; however, they are much fainter than their parent star, and separated by very small angles, so conventional imaging techniques are totally inadequate, and new methods are needed. A direct-imaging instrument for exoplanets must (1) suppress the bright star's image and diffraction pattern, and (2) suppress the star's scattered light from imperfections in the telescope. This chapter shows how exoplanets can be imaged by controlling diffraction with a coronagraph or interferometer, and controlling scattered light with deformable mirrors.},

In many respects, Bayesian methods have proven to be vastly superior to more traditional statistical tools, offering the advantage of higher efficiency and of a consistent conceptual basis for dealing with the problem of induction in the presence of uncertainty. This trend is likely to continue in the future, when the way we collect, manipulate and analyse observations and compare them with theoretical models will assume an even more central role in cosmology. This review is an introduction to Bayesian methods in cosmology and astrophysics and recent results in the field. I first present Bayesian probability theory and its conceptual underpinnings, Bayes' Theorem and the role of priors. I discuss the problem of parameter inference and its general solution, along with numerical techniques such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. I then review the theory and application of Bayesian model comparison, discussing the notions of Bayesian evidence and effective model complexity, and how to compute and interpret those quantities. Recent developments in cosmological parameter extraction and Bayesian cosmological model building are summarized, highlighting the challenges that lie ahead.},

  abstract = {Exoplanets, or planets outside our own solar system, have long been of interest to astronomers; however, only in the past two decades have scientists had the technology to characterize and study planets so far away from us. With advanced telescopes and spectrometers, astronomers are discovering more exoplanets every year. The two most prolific methods for detecting exoplanets, radial velocity, which measures the wobble of an exoplanet's parent star, and transit, which detects the passage of a planet in front of its star, are responsible for the discovery of the vast majority of exoplanets we know about so far. Other methods such as direct imaging, timing, and gravitational microlensing are less applicable but can sometimes yield accurate data to confirm planets found by radial velocity or transit photometry. Astronomers will continue to find large numbers of new exoplanets in the near future, but it will become increasingly harder to do so after all the planets close to our solar system are discovered.},

  abstract = {We present a lightweight, flexible, and high-performance framework for inferring the properties of gravitational-wave events. By combining likelihood heterodyning, automatically-differentiable and accelerator-compatible waveforms, and gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling enhanced by normalizing flows, we achieve full Bayesian parameter estimation for real events like GW150914 and GW170817 within a minute of sampling time. Our framework does not require pretraining or explicit reparameterizations and can be generalized to handle higher dimensional problems. We present the details of our implementation and discuss trade-offs and future developments in the context of other proposed strategies for real-time parameter estimation. Our code for running the analysis is publicly available on GitHub https://github.com/kazewong/jim.},

  abstract = {New requirements are placed upon the method of reducing the light diffracted by the telescope objective when astrometric measurements are made near the sun. The technique of Lyot greatly reduces the diffracted light, but since the aperture stop in this technique is not rigidly fixed to the objective, sizeable variations in coma and distortion are introduced when the stop moves with respect to the optic axis of the objective.If, however, instead of the Lyot system, an apodized objective is used to reduce the diffracted light, the aperature stop becomes rigidly fixed to the objective thereby overcoming the above difficulty. It is shown that for an objective apodized with a square aperture the diffracted light is reduced by four orders of magnitude below that for a circular aperture for one-half the azimuthal field and for distances greater than 400 sec from the solar limb.A general expression for the diffracted intensity from a circular aperture for points exterior to a disk image is obtained, and its leading terms are examined.},
